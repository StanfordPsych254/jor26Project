I have chosen to replicate Study 3 from Scopelliti, Loewenstein, & Vosgerau (2015). This study shows that people's efforts to make good impressions on others often backfire and make the person less likeable when their efforts at self-promotion are misconstrued as bragging. 
This study is related to my interest in the real-world costs of self-esteem maintenance motives. Though the specific focus of this study is the consequences of seeking to make positive impressions more so than trying to maintain a sense of self-worth,
they share the common theme of motives related to the self interfering with the pursuit of other goals. 

This study should be especially convenient to replicate since a) the original study was conducted on Mechanical Turk, and b) the authors have already provided all materials for the study on the Open Science Framework site. 
On the design level, the main challenge for my project should be obtaining sufficient power. The original study was conducted with 456 participants, each compensated with $1.00. It seems unlikely that I will have the sort of 
funds available to come close to matching this. Some effects may be easier (d=.57) to replicate with a smaller sample than others (d=.21), so this concern does not entirely validate my choice of study, though it will likely be a 
serious limitation. On a personal level, the main challenge for this project will be learning to use javascript as a tool for programming studies. This particular study should be easier to program than most, as the participant is 
responding mostly with text entry and likert scale responses, and the manipulation is a simple change in wording and content of a question.

The study involves two phases. In the first phase, a first group of participants is asked to write a person profile describing themself. Compared to the control condition, participants iIn the "maximizing other's interest" condition
are additionally informed that their profile will be viewed by others and that they should aim to maximize the reader's interest in meeting them. These participants then rate how much the readers would be interested in meeting them, 
how likeable they would seem, etc. A second group of participants then read the profiles of the first group and indicate the same things that the first group were asked to predict. The comparisons between the first group's predictions 
and the second groups reports, as differing by condition, is the primary focus of this study.
